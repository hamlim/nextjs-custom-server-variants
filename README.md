# Next.js Custom Server Example Apps

This repo is meant to serve as an example of using a Custom Node.js server alongside Next.js with both v13.5.6 and v14 Next.js releases (running on Node v16.20.1 and v20.6.1 respectively).

## Running:

- `cd` into either `./next-13` or `./next-14`
- Change node version via `fnm use` or `nvm use` or a similar tool
- Run `yarn` to install deps
- Run `yarn dev` to run the app in dev mode
- Visit `localhost:3000` to see the app
